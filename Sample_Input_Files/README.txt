# This directory contains sample input files used by the scripts:

1] Candidate Genes File (should be in .xlsx format)

3] Sample Interaction File (produced by the Interaction_parser)

4] Sample Uniprot File (produced by the Uniprot_parser.py)

5] Samples file (metadata file describing the samples .xlsx)


# There is a separate directory in the repository for GTEX data. Unlike above sample files, the GTEX directory
